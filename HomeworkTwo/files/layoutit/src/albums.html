			<h3>
				<center>1. Pablo Honey</center>
			</h3>
		</div>

			<p>
				<strong>Pablo Honey</strong> is the debut studio album by the English alternative rock band Radiohead, released on 22 February 1993 by Parlophone Records in the United Kingdom and by Capitol Records in the United States. The album was produced by Sean Slade and Paul Q. Kolderie, and was recorded at Chipping Norton Recording Studios and Courtyard Studio in Oxfordshire, England from September to November 1992. The album's title comes from a Jerky Boys prank call skit in which the prank caller says to his victim, "Pablo, honey? Please come to Florida!" This is sampled on the song "How Do You?".<br>
<br>
The album received a generally favourable reception from critics, but was criticised by many for its derivative grunge sound and its inclusion of underdeveloped songs, and is often held in a negative light in comparison to the band's subsequent studio albums. However, some retrospectives have shown it in a more positive light. The album produced three charting singles, "Anyone Can Play Guitar", "Stop Whispering", and perhaps the band's most well-known hit on mainstream radio, "Creep". Pablo Honey peaked at #22 on the UK Albums Chart, and was certified platinum in the UK and other countries.

				<center>2. The Bends</center>
			</h3>
		</div>
			<center><img alt="Bootstrap Image Preview" src="thebends.jpg"></center>
			<p>
				<strong>The Bends</strong> is the second studio album by the English alternative rock band Radiohead, released on 13 March 1995 by Parlophone Records in the United Kingdom and by Capitol Records in the United States. The album was produced by John Leckie at EMI Studios in London, England and was engineered by Nigel Godrich, who would go on to co-produce all future albums by the band. The Bends marked the beginning of a shift in aesthetics and themes for the band, with greater use of keyboards, and more abrasive guitar tracks, while balancing them with subtler ones. The introspective grunge-influenced style of their debut studio album Pablo Honey (1993) evolved into more multi-layered rock with cryptic lyrics and larger ideas, as the band and its lead singer and songwriter Thom Yorke reacted against the rigors of their near-constant world tours.

			<p>
				<strong>OK Computer</strong> is the third studio album by the English alternative rock band Radiohead, released in 1997 on Parlophone and Capitol Records. OK Computer was the first self-produced Radiohead album, with assistance from Nigel Godrich. Radiohead recorded the album in Oxfordshire and Bath between 1996 and early 1997, mostly in the historic mansion St. Catherine's Court. The band made a deliberate attempt to distance themselves from the guitar-oriented, lyrically introspective style of their previous album, The Bends. OK Computer's abstract lyrics, densely layered sound and wide range of influences laid the groundwork for Radiohead's later, more experimental work.

				<center>4. Kid A</center>

		</div>
			<center><img alt="Bootstrap Image Preview" src="kida.jpg"></center>
			<p>
				<strong>Kid A</strong> is the fourth studio album by the English rock band Radiohead, released on 2 October 2000 by Parlophone. On the verge of a breakdown after promoting Radiohead's 1997 album OK Computer, songwriter Thom Yorke envisioned a radical change in direction. Radiohead replaced their rock sound with synthesisers, drum machines, the ondes Martenot, string orchestras and brass instruments, incorporating influences from genres such as electronic music, krautrock, jazz, and 20th-century classical music. They recorded Kid A with OK Computer producer Nigel Godrich in Paris, Copenhagen, Gloucestershire and their hometown Oxford, England. The sessions produced over 20 tracks; Radiohead saved many of them for their subsequent album, Amnesiac, released the following year.

			<p>
				<strong>Amnesiac</strong> is the fifth studio album by the English rock band Radiohead, released on 5 June 2001 internationally by Parlophone. Recorded during the same sessions for the band's previous album Kid A (2000) with producer Nigel Godrich, the album incorporates similar influences of electronic music, 20th century classical music, jazz and krautrock. Singer Thom Yorke described it as "another take on Kid A, a form of explanation." Its lyrics and artwork explore themes influenced by memory and reincarnation, with influences from ancient Greek and Egyptian mythology.

			<center><img alt="Bootstrap Image Preview" src="hail.jpg"></center>
			<p>
				<strong>Hail to the Thief</strong> is the sixth album by the English rock band Radiohead, produced by longtime Radiohead producer Nigel Godrich. The final album released under Radiohead's recording contract with EMI, it was released on 9 June 2003 by EMI subsidiary Parlophone Records.<br>
<br>
Following Radiohead's albums Kid A (2000) and Amnesiac (2001), which incorporated jazz, classical and electronic influences, Hail to the Thief features more traditional rock instrumentation but retains electronic elements such as drum machines, synthesisers and digital manipulation. To avoid the protracted recording sessions of previous albums, Radiohead recorded Hail to the Thief quickly, focusing on recording live takes rather than overdubs. Songwriter Thom Yorke wrote many of the lyrics in response to the War on Terror and the resurgence of right-wing politics in the west.

				<center>7. In Rainbows</center>
			</h3>
		</div>
			<center><img alt="Bootstrap Image Preview" src="rainb.jpg"></center>
			<p>
				<strong>In Rainbows</strong> is the seventh studio album by the English rock band Radiohead, self-released on 10 October 2007 as a pay-what-you-want download. It was followed by a physical release internationally by XL Recordings on 3 December 2007 and in the United States on 1 January 2008 by TBD Records. It was Radiohead's first release after their six-album recording contract with EMI ended with their previous album Hail to the Thief (2003).<br>
<br>
Radiohead worked on In Rainbows for more than two years, beginning in early 2005. In mid-2006, after their initial recording sessions with their new producer Spike Stent proved fruitless, the band toured Europe and North America performing In Rainbows material, before re-enlisting their longtime producer Nigel Godrich. The album's songwriting is more personal than previous Radiohead albums, with singer Thom Yorke describing most of the songs as his versions of "seduction songs".[4] Radiohead incorporated a variety of musical styles and instruments, using electronic instruments, string arrangements, pianos, and the ondes Martenot.

				<center>8. The King Of Limbs</center>
			</h3>
		</div>
			<center><img alt="Bootstrap Image Preview" src="kingof.jpg"></center>
			<p>
				<strong>The King of Limbs</strong> is the eighth studio album by the English rock band Radiohead, released on the band's website on 18 February 2011 as a download in MP3 and WAV formats. CD and 12" vinyl versions were released on 28 March 2011 through Radiohead's Ticker Tape imprint and by XL Recordings in the United Kingdom, TBD Records in the United States and by Hostess Entertainment in Japan.<br>
<br>
Following the protracted recording and more conventional alternative rock instrumentation of Radiohead's previous studio album In Rainbows (2007), Radiohead developed much of The King of Limbs by sampling and looping their recordings. The album was produced by longtime Radiohead producer Nigel Godrich. Lead singer and songwriter Thom Yorke described the album as "an expression of wildness and mutation". Radiohead released no singles from the album, but released a music video for "Lotus Flower" that spawned a viral Internet meme.

			<p>
				<strong>A Moon Shaped Pool</strong> is the ninth studio album by the English rock band Radiohead, released as a download and on paid streaming services on 8 May 2016. CD and LP releases followed in June 2016 through XL Recordings. Radiohead also sold a special edition, containing two extra tracks and additional artwork, from their website.<br>
<br>
Radiohead recorded A Moon Shaped Pool in southern France with longtime producer Nigel Godrich. It includes several songs written some years earlier; "True Love Waits" dates to at least 1995, "Burn the Witch" to 2000 and "Present Tense" to 2008. Several tracks feature strings and choral vocals arranged by Radiohead guitarist Jonny Greenwood and performed by the London Contemporary Orchestra. "Ful Stop" features additional drumming from Clive Deamer, who performed with Radiohead on the King of Limbs tour. The artwork was created by longtime Radiohead collaborator Stanley Donwood.
